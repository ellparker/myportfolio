                  <p>I must testify that yesterday I cried. Although it was not the first time, it had been quite a long time since the last time, and I had never cried like this before. You see, usually I cry alone. But this time, fir the first time, I shared my tears with a circle of women who had all come together with the intent of cleansing and healing our wombs. I attended my first ever sister circle: Womb Wellness Workshop. I had no idea what I would be walking into. What I discovered was a deeper insight and knowledge of myself, and I walked away with a deeper connection to the Goddess within.</p>

                  <p>This one day urban workshop was right on time for me. When I received the invitation via Facebook for “Womb Wellness Training”, something inside of me immediately woke up. I responded that I would attend before even asking myself, “What is going on with my womb?” I closed my eyes and placed my hands over my womb to see what I could feel as I thought about my life and the condition of my womb. As reflections of my life passed through my mind, I realized I had been through a lot of crazy situations throughout my thirty-one years, and many extreme changes in just the last few years. But my hands, still covering my womb felt nothing. As I wondered why, my guess was that my womb had gone numb. Or maybe, it was just all in my mind. Immediately I knew that this workshop was definitely intended for me.</p>

                  <p>When I arrived at the workshop, I was greeted by a circle of women sharing their thoughts on what attracted them to the workshop. Most women, like me, were looking for healing for some type of pain or past trauma. After the introductions, we jumped right into an intimate discussion about our bodies facilitated by Ms. Kalarius. At the root of this discussion was the idea that we are all divine beings. More than just our physical bodies, we learned about our spiritual bodies including our auras, chakras, energy systems, and light bodies. It was a lot to take in, but Kalarius was an excellent teacher stopping to answer questions and make sure we could all understand. Through the knowledge and wisdom she shared, I was able to understand more clearly what was going on with me.</p>

                  <p>As a professional educator and therapist, much of my time gets devoted to helping others. In a flash, I realized that I had been challenging the universal direction to focus my attention on taking care of myself. A natural born fighter, I have trouble giving in and surrendering… even to myself! I can almost burst into laughter after admitting this, but every part of my being knows that my resistance was no laughing matter. The result of my resistance was a series of events and circumstances that threatened the foundation of my entire existence.</p>

                  <p>The most anticipated part of the workshop was the presentation of a series of exercises which included breathing techniques and guided meditations for mind, body and spiritual relief. Or should I say, release, all the way from the core. We learned how to focus our attention on the heart center located at the opening of the womb, and the heart signature located at the bottom of the heart. I had to look deep into the recesses of my heart and womb and pull up all of the most painful memories. All of the ghost of the traumas of my past. I had to face these ghost, to heal my soul. </p>

                  <p>I was trying to work through exactly why my womb felt like an empty black hole. The biggest issue that came up for me was fear and self loathing. Not taking into account anything that anyone else had ever done to me, I had to focus solely on myself. I realized I had abused myself for so long, that I made up my mind to block out the feeling and suppress the pain that I must have known was there. A subconscious decision of course, just to keep moving through life, in too much pain to keep still. At some point I knew I would have to stop, and let the rain come down. My body was trying to tell me. Symptoms manifested in the form of uncontrollable eating, especially warm and heavy foods; frequent colds, (two to three per season is frequent for me who normally never gets sick); various skin outbreaks; irrational spontaneous decisions with no plan for completion; allowing physical assaults, sometimes self inflicted; etc. As I pulled up all of these thoughts and memories, I declared that I was tired of abusing the center of my universe. And as I let the tears flow, I released all of the unpleasantness back into the light and the love of God.</p>

                  <blockquote>

                  </blockquote>

                  <p>This was one of the most moving experiences of my entire life. Kelarius even went a step further in helping to facilitate the work being done by graciously receiving the plight of every woman there, and returning all of the things that were weighing us down back into the light of Love. Everyone admitted feeling much lighter, and agreed that much work had been done. We ran much later than expected, but no one wanted to leave without experiencing all that the workshop had to offer. A beautiful dance performance by one of the participants set the stage for the unbridled self expression that was the focus of the day. Healthy, hearty foods and plenty of water and juices were provided to nourish our bodies as we embarked on the task of healing our souls. Everyone was also treated to some accutonics provided by Tchiya Amet. I appreciate Amber for the invitation and for providing such a warm and beautiful space for us all to share in this experience. I also appreciate all of the lovely and talented women who shared their gifts, and opened up their hearts to share in the work of healing our souls. </p>
